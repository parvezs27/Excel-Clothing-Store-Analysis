## Project Information
Employed as Data Analysts for Modern Traditional Clothing Store in India, who sell womens and mens clothing through various online channels such as Myntra, Ajio and Amazon. Business executives of Modern Traditional Clothing have requested us to create an annual sales report, with the purpose of understanding their customer base and how to grow their sales in 2023. the business is performing, to help them with business decisions. The executives have advised that they currently don't have any dashboards, and haven't exactly specified what they would like us to deliver. No specific guidance has been provided on how to approach the task, what metrics they would like to see or any examples they may have which they wish to recreate. As analysts, it is upto use to understand the business, the business situation, what the stakeholders will need to see and how to best showcase this keeping in mind the target audience. 

We have been given the dataset in the form of an excel file (link below). We will begin with data cleaning, then move onto processing, analysis and finally dashboard creation.

## Key points of this project
- Pie charts have been used, generally pie charts are frowned upon in data analysis, but since no thin slices we can do.
- Understand the audience, do they have vision isuses? Colorblindness? Red and green color blindness is the most common.

## Data Checking
This is the analysis before the analysis. We have been given data but we have to make sure the data is appropriate for our task, will the data help us provide the executives with an understanding of their customer base and help them with business deicsions to grow their sales in 2023? Let's have a look. 
We can see columns providing demographic data such as gender and age. We also have a ship city column providing geographic information.
